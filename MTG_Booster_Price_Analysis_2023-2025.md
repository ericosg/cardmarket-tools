## SUMMARY

**2024 Offers the Best Value:** The clear winner is **Murders at Karlov Manor** from 2024, offering the lowest per-booster cost when buying boxes. March of the Machine from 2023 follows closely behind. Both sets demonstrate that standard releases from recent years provide exceptional value compared to premium or specialty sets.

**2025 Sets Show Strong Competition:** The newest year brings competitive pricing, with **Aetherdrift** leading the pack at just €3.20 per booster in boxes and the lowest total box price (€96.14). Spider-Man and Edge of Eternities also rank in the top 5 for box value, showing that 2025 sets are priced aggressively. However, Universes Beyond sets like Final Fantasy and Avatar command premium prices.

**Why Premium Sets Cost More:** Commander Masters and Modern Horizons 3 carry significantly higher prices (2-3x standard sets) because they're designed for eternal formats with powerful reprints and sought-after cards. These sets target experienced players willing to pay premium prices for high-value cards rather than casual players looking for budget-friendly draft experiences.

**General Trends in Play Booster Pricing:** Since the shift to Play Boosters in 2024, standard set boosters average €3.50-4.50 for singles and €3.00-4.00 per booster in boxes. Premium and specialty sets (Universes Beyond, Masters, Horizons) range from €5-15+ per single booster. Buying boxes consistently saves 10-25% compared to buying single boosters, making display boxes the best value for players who want to draft or crack multiple packs.
