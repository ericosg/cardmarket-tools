## SUMMARY

**Spider-Man Takes the Crown:** The updated data shows **Spider-Man** from 2025 now offers the absolute best value at **2.78 €/booster** in boxes, beating out Murders at Karlov Manor by just 6 cents. At under €100 for a full box (99.93 €), it's the most economical booster box across all three years. The Marvel crossover surprisingly beats all standard sets, making it an exceptional draft value.

**2024-2025 Dominate the Top Rankings:** Of the top 15 best-value boxes, **12 are from 2024-2025**, showing that recent sets offer significantly better value than 2023 releases. Murders at Karlov Manor (2024) and March of the Machine (2023) remain strong contenders, while 2025's Aetherdrift and Edge of Eternities offer the lowest total box costs.

**2025 Sets Show Aggressive Pricing:** The newest year brings highly competitive pricing across the board:
- **Spider-Man** (2.78 €/booster) - Best overall value
- **Aetherdrift** (3.20 €/booster) - Lowest total box cost at 96.14 €
- **Edge of Eternities** (3.33 €/booster) - Strong value for Standard
- **Dragonstorm** (3.79 €/booster) - Mid-range pricing

However, premium 2025 Universes Beyond sets like **Final Fantasy** (5.10 €/booster) and **Avatar** (4.00 €/booster) command significantly higher prices.

**Why Premium Sets Cost More:** Commander Masters and Modern Horizons 3 carry significantly higher prices (2-4x standard sets) because they're designed for eternal formats with powerful reprints and sought-after cards. Modern Horizons 3's per-booster cost (10.62 €) actually exceeds the single booster price (8.10 €), reflecting high demand and limited supply. These sets target experienced players willing to pay premium prices for high-value cards rather than casual players looking for budget-friendly draft experiences.

**General Trends in Play Booster Pricing:** Since the shift to Play Boosters in 2024, standard set boosters average €3.50-4.50 for singles and €2.80-4.00 per booster in boxes. Premium and specialty sets (Universes Beyond, Masters, Horizons) range from €5-15+ per single booster. Buying boxes consistently saves 15-35% compared to buying single boosters, making display boxes the best value for players who want to draft or crack multiple packs.

**Best Time to Buy:** If you're looking for the best value for drafting or casual pack opening, **Spider-Man and Murders at Karlov Manor** offer the lowest per-booster costs. For 2025 Standard play, **Aetherdrift** (lowest total box price at €96.14) and **Edge of Eternities** are your best bets for affordable gameplay.
